# React Convex Template

I did this one for myself.

- React
- Convex
- Convex Auth
- Vercel
- Tailwind
- Shadcn

Has some nice prettier + eslint rules that I like. I just push to the main branch btw.

I also use the same Auth logic + UI as base for all my side projects hehe + just deploy to Vercel.

Generally, I like using most of what Vercel has to offer, it's usually enough for me, I sometimes reach for other tools if necessary but considering Convex as a whole backend platform, I usually need very little from external services lol

# What can you build with this?

You can build anything almost, including multiplayer games.

# Convetions I enjoy

`handlePromise` for dealing with promises over try/catch.

I import convex stuff from `@/convex/...`

---

You can see my lint config + prettier of what I prefer I guess, generally a fan of clean and simple code.

---

`InputWithFeedback` component for inputs with error + helper text.

# Tailor to your product

- index.css file for the theme -> just ask ai to do it for you i guess
- index.html file for all meta tags
- package.json name license, etc.
